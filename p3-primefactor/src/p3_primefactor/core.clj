;;-------------assuming I can get a sieve working, then check by trial division against the found primes.
;; it should be that to find the largestprimefactor of n we only have to get prime factors up to n/2.
;; Suppose that there are only 2 factors of n besides n,1, and these factors are 2 and n/2.
;; suppose that n/2 is prime.  for there to be a larger prime factor of n, we would have to have some other 
;; factor smaller than 2.  The only available is 1.  In that case the other factor is n, and n is prime.
;; Suppose that n/2 is not prime.  This means it is divisible by prime factors < n/2, so the largest prime 
;; factor of n is still < n/2.

;; for this case either 600851475143 is prime, or the largest prime factor <= n/2.  If we test all
;; primes <= n/2, and n is divisble by none of them, then n is prime
